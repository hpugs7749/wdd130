            <p>Hey friends, my name is Hunter Pugsley. I am from Elwood, Utah. Which is in Northern Utah. I love to play video games,
               read books, fish with my Grandpa, and watch TV shows with my wife Kayla! I am a relatively
               happy individual, and I love my relationship with God and Jesus Christ.

            <p>Utah is a fun state to live in. You get all four seasons. It is definitely a desert like climate, and it does 
                not have a lot of green. The mountains are beautfil. They are magestic! I love the rural town I live in.
                It is relatively quiet, and I really enjoy knowing lots of people. Utah is great 😁
