SEMANTIC VS NON-SEMANTIC
This is my notes for my second week of html learning. The first interesting fact that I have learned
is the difference between semantic & non-semantic elements. Semantic elements to html si what provides
the specific meaning and structure to html coding. Non-semantic elemnts are more involved with classing
and iding attributes within the code.
